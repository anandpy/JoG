Post Title   : Donated My Blood for Someone's Life
PostText     : Once i was returning from highway no 5.i suddenly saw a truck driver who had banged his truck against a wall.The steering had pierced his chest.he was crying for  4 help and nobody was there to help him.I stopped my bike and rushed to help him. He said-i am going to die so leave me.I said-uncle-u will see the sunshine of tomorrow.Then i dragged him out of his truck made him sit on my bike...then i drove him to Bhubaneswar Capital Hospital where he got first aid thank god his blood group was A+ and mine was also A+  So i was able to donate him blood.Upto till date he is smiling like hell and always waving hand to me whenever i am driving my bike in NH 5.i can never forget that smile of gratitude in his face.i luv him...as my fate which compelled me to do something out of unselfishness...dat changed my life!

Post Title   : Love is blind
PostText     : On way to college at 6a.m at the railway station.i see this blind couple struggling for directions to the train amidst all the hustle and bustle of people rushing for work and class.(you know how difficult it gets during peak hours) With nobody to help them i rush towards them and help them board the train safely. those three words they said"god bless you" gave me a reason to smile all day long.
