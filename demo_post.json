He said-i am going to die,so leave me.I said-uncle-u will see the sunshine of tomorrow.Then i dragged him out of his truck,made him sit on my bike...then i drove him to Bhubaneswar Capital Hospital where he got first aid thank god his blood group was A+ and mine was also A+, So i was able to donate him blood.Upto till date he is smiling like hell and always waving hand to me whenever i am driving my bike in NH 5.i can never forget that smile of gratitude in his face.i luv him...as my fate which compelled me to do something out of unselfishness...dat changed my life!",

But later she came back and I knew then that she was desperate for the money. The yellow roses had torn petals and they were all dried up. \nI saw that little look on her face and my heart sank. I knew just then that I needed to buy atleast one. I had just ten rupees.\nShe said that one of the roses is for 10, but I asked her to give two in that amount and so she did in the desperation.\nLater I saw her across the street smiling at me. I called her back and gifted one of the roses to her. That smile of hers made my day.\nAfter reaching the station, I was so overwhelmed, that I gave the rickshaw driver my second rose and he said he will never forget me.\nThese few minutes just showed me how blessed I am with a wonderful life full of luxury and comfort while the girl at the signal or the rickshaw driver have barely a family.\nThis made a big impact on me. I always try to make them smile but the smile that still the brightest in my eyes is the one of the flower girl :)",

  "post_text": "‘Blissfully yours!!’\n\nGod wants us to live like the grass. Even if it's stepped on, crushed, burned and cut; it always persists and grows back even greener and stronger! \n\nThis write-up is dedicated to the person who has faced life as a challenge in itself, who has gone against the flow and has transcended the barriers of caste and religion to establish her blissful existence. She has emerged as victorious in her battle against the physical shortcomings and those worthless principles that stem the free-flow of life. Her life is a benchmark in itself which rejuvenates our souls the moment we relive those days. \n\nThe love of my life, my dearest cousin, has literally done wonders with her life: it’s amazing to see her comeback when the chips were completely down and out. Affected with juvenile diabetes right from the age of 17, she had almost lost zeal for life when a magical twist descended to transform her outlook. She used to skip classes, omit meals, cut down on her re-creative measures; or in short she had given in to the atrocities of life, but GOD had scripted a fairy-tale of sorts where she was destined to be the princess. Things HAD to change and CHANGE at a rapid pace.\n\nThankfully it did. She used to sit around the corner brooding over her cursed life, waiting for the shutters of death to descend - when somebody made her realise that life isn’t about mourning or agonising, it’s about conquering the impediments and rising above all.\n\nShe was an extremely talented swimmer but her illness was pegging her back from going ahead with her ambition. She had almost lost it, when her trainer Majid, stepped into her life and reincarnated her spirit to walk along the steep slope without when thinking of losing balance. He inspired her to think beyond those trivial short-comings and galvanised her step towards experiencing life to the fullest. He used to spend hours with her in form of interaction, training, motivating and innovating newer avenues of life; he just wanted her to jump in with full vigour.\n\nThis had to come! She finally started responding to his heart-felt calls and ‘their’ dedication started yielding rich dividends soon after. It was under Majid, that she won her first inter-state woman’s freestyle championship where she conquered her unbearable pain to clinch the top-spot amidst the best in business; she was unstoppable. \n\nAnd as it was destined the bond of love added a new flavour to their cherished association. She was the happiest person in the world when Majid proposed to her on her 18th Birthday; her ‘cursed’ life was starting to smile upon her yet again.\n\nBut destiny had yet another twist in store. Our family was totally against an inter-caste marriage; in fact at one point of time, she was told to choose one: her family or Majid as the way ahead. Both mental and physical torture followed; the toughest phase of her life had slowly made its way.\nShe didn’t give up. Insurmountable indeed!!\n\nShe had put in her best effort in terms of establishing her views in-front of the elders in the family; but in vain.\n\nMy uncle had other plans; he had already started looking for alternative career options for his daughter. But she was determined.\nShe was locked up in a dark room for a couple days, but didn’t break down. She was no longer the ‘escapist’ Ananya: her spirit was indomitable.\nShe rode on her blistering confidence to reach the final rounds of the All-India under 25 - Swimming championship...and Majid was there with her. She returned with a smile; she hid the intriguing pain that was killing her from inside.\nThere came my master-plan! The PLAN that could have sounded bold at the outset, but in this end, it managed to soothe quite a few senses.\n\nThere were a few shocked faces in the crowd when she kissed Majid in open air. \nWho cares? She had found her reason to smile, she had found her true love....she had INDEED crushed all those confinements and raised the bars of her glorious ambition.\nIt is truly said that- Life isn't always fair, but it will eventually make you the person you were meant to be!\nShe once told me that- “You may never change a broken past, but you can change a broken future! Live life to the fullest. No regrets!” GOLDEN words Dea, it’s so very true!\nLife is like a roller coaster, you have your ups and downs, your twists and turns, but at the end of the ride you are glad you rode it anyway. Salute to the spirit of mortality, Salute to the indomitable attributes of mankind – Bows! We are proud of you Dea. \nCongratulations on your new life, you have inspired MANY! GOD BLESS! And YES I am OVERJOYED to donate or rather GIFT her the reason to smile \n",

I think its my honor that I can give someone a little happiness. That is why I make sure when I am giving someone something I dont make them pity on their self instead I make them feel that I am kind of friend to them and they are just asking to me not begging.  Talking politely is really important to me and by that most of the time I hand-over some needy whenever I see someone. I use word \"needy\" instead of \"beggar\" so that I never behave superior to them. I think god has given us opportunity to show how much we can admire him and give to other what we have got.",

My friend and I were moved by seeing him like that, so we decided to help by buying him some food. Unfortunately, there was no eatery or grocery store in the area.   We asked the boy to wait at the same place and promised him that we would be back before very long. We went to the next street and found a grocery store there. I bought some packets of biscuits.   When we returned to the laundry the boy was still standing there. When I gave the biscuits to him he was delighted and said he hadn't really expected up to come back! He took the biscuits, gave us a thankful smile, and started munching!   Seeing his happiness also made our day!  ",

Autumn is a wonderful example of the fulfilment of many plants as we enjoy the abundance of fruits and vegetables that are harvested at this time in the cycles or seasons of life.",

  "post_text": "One day in my college I was on my scooty and roaming near the college canteen.. Since construction is going on in our campus so a large number of labour class people are living in the campus with their families. But on that one day I was alone and some 5-6 small labour family children of the age range between 2-6 years came to me saying \"DIDI bhookh lagi he kuch khane ko dedo. \" I was very much moved and thought of giving them a small treat for them at the canteen.. I made all of them sit in the canteen benches and went to the college bhaiya to ask him to give the kids something to eat. At first he was reluctant saying unko nahi khane ko dunga. wo bhut preshaan karte hein etc etc. Then I gave him a 100 ruppee note and said \"Bhaiya see I am paying you for watever they eat. You just give them wat they want to have\". Then they had 2 pranthas, some biscuits, tea and I also gave them few parle g packets to carry home for their family to eat.They sat with me for around 10-15 minutes but they were so happy that I was even more happy seeing the smiles and contentment on their faces. The smile and the thankfulness on their face was more than anything at that time. From then on till for another 1 year of my studies in the campus they met me a couple of times and each time I used to get them something or the other and they used to happily say \"Didi ap fir kab aoge\" and I was like don't worryy me jab b aungi tume acha acha khilaungi. The happiness on those small children's face was more than anything for me. :(\nNow that I have completed my graduation I still miss those kids and their happy moments with me.. :(",

  "post_title": "Birthday Cake For Street Kids ",
  "post_text": "I was buying something at my neighbourhood bakery when I saw two street kids - a very young boy with his baby sister. The little boy tried to buy whatever he could with his Rs. 15, but his sister cried and really wanted a piece of cream cake. He asked the salesman if the cake piece could be given for Rs. 10 but the bakery people just said \"No!\" and told them to go.\n\nI got irritated with the way the bakery people were treating these poor kids, and so, just as the brother and sister began walking away, I stopped them. I asked the little girl which cake she wanted - and then I bought four pieces - much to the surprise of the bakery people. I also bought them two Dairy Milk chocolates and two Frooty juice packets. The bakery person gave me the typical Indian question hand gesture and asked me why I was doing this.\n\nI didn't know know those kids, but all I know is, when that little girl stopped crying and looked at me with an attempt to smile, I knew I did the right thing. Things we salaried people take for granted mean a lot more to the less fortunate. I'm not saying everybody doing this on a daily basis is the right way to go, but more often than not, a single act of kindness will only make you feel good about yourself more than the good it does to the person you just helped. And that's the 'Joy of giving'.",
